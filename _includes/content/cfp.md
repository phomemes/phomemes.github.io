We invite researchers and practitioners to submit short papers describing an analysis of images in online social media spaces and political discourse, broadly defined.
Submissions are expected to be 4 to 8 pages in length, plus unlimited pages of references. 
These papers will be archived in ICWSM's workshop proceedings unless authors request otherwise.

Topics include:

- Analysis of image types (photos, memes, cartoons, etc.), 
- Impacts of images on political mobilization,
- Use of screenshots to circumvent platform moderation, 
- Identifying symbols of hate in online discourse,
- Identifying hate symbols embedded in images,
- Image appropriation for anti-social messaging, 
- Understanding meanings of visual memes,
- Integrating message context with visual media, 
- Tracking spread of images across platforms,
- The categories of images used in misinformation,
- Tracking conflicts with visual media,
- Measuring multi-modal user behavior, and
- Documenting antisocial gestures in presidential debates.

TODO: Add link to the EasyChair and author kit
-->

Papers should be submitted through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=phomemes2023) and use the [AAAI author kit](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/aaai-2023-author-kit/wxnmhzcrjbpc).

The workshop invites authors to submit three types of papers:

- Research Papers (8+ pages)
- Work-in-Progress Papers or Research Proposals (2-4 pages)
- Provocations or Critical Approaches (1-2 pages)

<!-- Core research papers must contain novel, previously-unpublished material related to the topics of the workshop. Accepted papers will be presented orally and will appear in the workshop proceedings.
Work-In-Progress papers are shorter and meant to describe smaller, more focused research findings or research that is still in progress. Both of these paper types undergo a rigorous peer-review process and will be archived in the workshop proceedings, unless otherwise asked by the authors.

Practitioners are also invited to submit core and work-in-progress papers, but we recognize that academic review may not be appropriate for practitioner contributions. 
These authors may instead submit a brief 1-2-page paper that will not be included in the proceedings. 
We encourage submissions describing real-world experiences and case studies of interest to the workshop audience.
These submissions will be reviewed according to relevance and ability to contribute to discussions. -->
